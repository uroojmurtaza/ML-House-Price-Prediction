To add more features to the data, revisit the first code cell, and change this line of code to include more column names:\n","```python\n","features = ['LotArea', 'YearBuilt', '1stFlrSF', '2ndFlrSF', 'FullBath', 'BedroomAbvGr', 'TotRmsAbvGrd']\n","```\n","\n","Some features will cause errors because of issues like missing values or non-numeric data types.  Here is a complete list of potential columns that you might like to use, and that won't throw errors:\n","- 'MSSubClass'\n","- 'LotArea'\n","- 'OverallQual' \n","- 'OverallCond' \n","- 'YearBuilt'\n","- 'YearRemodAdd' \n","- '1stFlrSF'\n","- '2ndFlrSF' \n","- 'LowQualFinSF' \n","- 'GrLivArea'\n","- 'FullBath'\n","- 'HalfBath'\n","- 'BedroomAbvGr' \n","- 'KitchenAbvGr' \n","- 'TotRmsAbvGrd' \n","- 'Fireplaces' \n","- 'WoodDeckSF' \n","- 'OpenPorchSF'\n","- 'EnclosedPorch' \n","- '3SsnPorch' \n","- 'ScreenPorch' \n","- 'PoolArea' \n","- 'MiscVal' \n","- 'MoSold' \n","- 'YrSold'\n","\n","Look at the list of columns and think about what might affect home prices.
